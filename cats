<h1> 5 FOODS TOXIC TO CATS</h1><br>
<p> Most cat owners feed their cats commercial cat food, which comes in various forms: Dry Kibble: Dry cat food is convenient and helps with dental health.<br>
   Canned/Wet Food: Canned cat food has higher moisture content and can be beneficial for hydration.<br>
    Semi-Moist Food: This is a middle ground between dry and wet food.</p>
    <p>Cats can eat all types of boneless meat and filleted fish in small amounts.<br>
       You should trim large amounts of fat and gristle and remove before feeding your cat meat.<br>
        Dont forget that raw food can carry parasites and bacteria that cause illness in cats. You should only serve cooked meat and fish to your cat.</p><br>

<p>Cats can eat grapes only in minimal amounts. Ingestion of large quantities of grapes and raisins can cause an upset stomach or even cause poisoning in cats.<br>
  Symptoms of grape toxicity include loss of appetite, lethargy, increased thirst, dehydration, and abdominal pain.<br>
  If you notice any of these symptoms after your cat has eaten grapes, call your vet immediately.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, theyre not safe for cats or dogs to eat. Its not exactly known why raisins are toxic to cats, but just like grapes, they can cause vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and a range of other symptoms in our feline friends.<br>
   In severe cases, raisin poisoning in cats can cause life-threatening kidney failure.

<p>Cats cant eat chocolate because cocoa contains caffeine and theobromine. Both ingredients can lead to a toxic build-up, leading to severe symptoms, particularly liver failure.<br>
  At home, make sure that you keep your chocolatey treats and baking ingredients in places that are way out of your cats reach.
  If your cat eats chocolate, make sure to call your vet and make an urgent appointment. </p>
  <br>
<h1><li>ALCOHOL</li></h1>

<p> Most types of alcohol contain ethanol, which is toxic to cats, and just one teaspoon is enough to cause alcohol poisoning.<br>
   When a cat ingests alcohol, its liver and kidneys struggle to get rid of the poison, especially if they consume too much. Alcohol-based cleaning products such as mouthwash or sanitizer can also harm your cat </p>
   <br>
   <h1><li>ONIOINS AND GARLIC</li></h1>

   <p> They are in the Allium family and are poisonous to cats.
    Garlic is 3 to 5 times more toxic than onion.
    Alliums contain toxins that damage red blood cells, leading to anemia.
    Even cooked or dried forms of onions and garlic are toxic to cats. </p>
